# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Intent ([source](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/abstract_factory))

- Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- A hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible "platforms", and the construction of a suite of "products".
- The new operator considered harmful.
